## About this project
In this repository, you will find the two exercices about the basic functions of HTML and CSS.

## Content
You will find two folders;
One containing the exercise " The Story of the Chinese Farmer".
The other one was to recreate the layout of one of the two proposed sites.
I chose to redo the layout of the Turlututu site.
